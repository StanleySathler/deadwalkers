## Dead Walkers
A clone of the DayZ game, made specially for [Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue).

---

_**Note:** This game mode is not being maintained anymore and it was never finished. Currently, you can check [this repository](https://github.com/NullSystemWorks/mtadayz) being maintained by the first DayZ's original developers._

### What is this repository?
DayZ is originally a game mod created by Dean Hall for the game Arma II.

After its big success, some guys decided to create a game mod based on DayZ, but this time, for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas.

The biggest problem related to the Multi Theft Auto: DayZ is that it was not open-source.

This repository tries to recreate all the base functionalities, but with an open-source code, so everyone can contribute to its development.
