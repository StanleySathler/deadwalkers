### Dead Walkers is a gamemode based on DayZ


Dead Walkers is a gamemode created for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas. It's an improved DayZ for Grand Theft Auto players, which provides same features: items around the world, vehicles, PVP, zombies, and general survivor.

The first version of this gamemode was created by Marwin, but his code got stolen and distributed around the web.

So, we decided to replicate it, following the main logical details, but rewriting all the code, making it better. And totally Open Source, under MIT License.
