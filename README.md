Dead Walkers
==

### What is?
Dead Walkers is a gamemode based on known MTA DayZ. The difference is that Dead Walkers is open-source and has a clean code, which makes it maintainable.

The gamemode is under construction, so, you can not play it yet. If you want to contribute with something, just fork the project and make a pull-request. :)
